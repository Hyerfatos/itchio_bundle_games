Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.

We\u2019ve also included a concept art browser, and recorded a commentary track with the game\u2019s original creators Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman, Larry Ahern, Peter Chan, Peter McConnell and Clint Bajakian.\n\nDay of the Tentacle was Tim Schafer\u2019s first game as co-project lead, and a much beloved cult classic! This special edition has been lovingly restored and remade with the care and attention that can only come from involving the game's original creators.",

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \n\nFEATURES:\n\n Procedurally Generated Dungeons\n Roguelike Mode for fans of extreme challenge\n 70+ different types of monsters, with different traits and custom mechanics\n Xbox and Steam controller support\n Dungeons & Streamers - Twitch and Mixer integration\n Monthly and all-time Leaderboards, 200+ Achievements\n\nBook of Demons is the first installment of Return 2 Games - a series of original mid-core titles, inspired by the early golden days of PC gaming.\n\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\nIt\u2019s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\n\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\n\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\n\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book.\nIt\u2019s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\n\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\n\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.\n",

    "description": "ECHO is a Third-Person Science Fiction Adventure.\n\nAfter a century in stasis the girl En arrives at her destination: A Palace out of legend, a marvel of the old civilization eons gone, still awaiting its first human occupants. Out here, using forgotten technologies, she hopes to bring back a life that shouldn\u2019t have been lost. But nothing could prepare her for what she\u2019ll face in the ancient halls below.\n\nThe experience starts as a character driven journey of discovery, but as it unfolds it evolves into something altogether more punishing. The Palace studies everything you do, everything you are, to use it against you. Gameplay revolves around stealth, action and manipulation, as you face off against the ultimate enemy: Yourself.\n\nTHE WAY YOU PLAY SHAPES THE GAME\nIn ECHO everything has consequence: As you try to wield its magical technologies it becomes apparent that the Palace has a will of its own\u2026 It creates \u201cEchoes\u201d \u2013 exact copies of you in every way \u2013 that behave like you and only do the things you do. So the way you play the game shapes your enemy. If you sprint, soon the Echoes will get faster. If you sneak, they will get stealthier. If you shoot, they will learn to shoot back. The game constantly reacts to your every choice and input.\n\nLEARNING MECHANICS\nThe Palace \"reboots\" every so often, resulting in a blackout. This blackout-cycle is the rhythm at which the Echoes get updated with your latest behavior, learning and unlearning from your actions. During the blackout the palace is blind, giving you the freedom to act without consequence. This is the time to run and gun and do all the things you don\u2019t want the Echoes to learn.\nThe experience is one of being up against your own choices from the last blackout-cycle, giving you a way of shaping the game from cycle to cycle. So no matter if you prefer to go stealth or action one thing is certain, you need to keep your wits about you if you want to survive the Palace.\n\nRICH STORY AND ATMOSPHERE\nAt the heart of ECHO is the story. The game starts as a narrative experience, focused on En and her journey into the Palace and her past. Who is she and what is her connection to the Palace? Who is this man that she needs to revive, and what was the circumstances surrounding his death? Slowly these things are uncovered as she descends into the dark halls below.",

Choose strategically or make decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences (and unpredictable side effects!)\n\n13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients\u2019 problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients\u2019 satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge. \n\nSo-called \u201creal\u201d (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman prove these medical establishment elitists wrong!\n\nFEATURES\n\n\nPerform real* astrology: Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an exact science!)\n\nSolve Hilarious Problems: Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies!\n\nChange Lives: Win your patients\u2019 favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other.

His name is Simon Forman, \u201cDoctor\u201d of Astrology, Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can find their lost pets and predict their futures!

The real doctors return to London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down...\n\nSUMMARY\nAstrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare\u2019s London.

What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?\n\nExplore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:\nCan\u2019t reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design:\nExplore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly:\nThe game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.",

Out here, using forgotten technologies, she hopes to bring back a life that shouldn\u2019t have been lost. But nothing could prepare her for what she\u2019ll face in the ancient halls below.\n\nThe experience starts as a character driven journey of discovery, but as it unfolds it evolves into something altogether more punishing. The Palace studies everything you do, everything you are, to use it against you. Gameplay revolves around stealth, action and manipulation, as you face off against the ultimate enemy: Yourself.\n\nTHE WAY YOU PLAY SHAPES THE GAME\nIn ECHO everything has consequence: As you try to wield its magical technologies it becomes apparent that the Palace has a will of its own\u2026 It creates \u201cEchoes\u201d \u2013 exact copies of you in every way \u2013 that behave like you and only do the things you do. So the way you play the game shapes your enemy. If you sprint, soon the Echoes will get faster. If you sneak, they will get stealthier. If you shoot, they will learn to shoot back. The game constantly reacts to your every choice and input.\n\nLEARNING MECHANICS\nThe Palace \"reboots\" every so often, resulting in a blackout. This blackout-cycle is the rhythm at which the Echoes get updated with your latest behavior, learning and unlearning from your actions. During the blackout the palace is blind, giving you the freedom to act without consequence. This is the time to run and gun and do all the things you don\u2019t want the Echoes to learn.\nThe experience is one of being up against your own choices from the last blackout-cycle, giving you a way of shaping the game from cycle to cycle. So no matter if you prefer to go stealth or action one thing is certain, you need to keep your wits about you if you want to survive the Palace.\n\nRICH STORY AND ATMOSPHERE\nAt the heart of ECHO is the story. The game starts as a narrative experience, focused on En and her journey into the Palace and her past. Who is she and what is her connection to the Palace? Who is this man that she needs to revive, and what was the circumstances surrounding his death? Slowly these things are uncovered as she descends into the dark halls below.",

Featuring a cast of dynamic new characters and four fascinating cases for you to cut your teeth on, Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney brings all the drama of an action-packed crime thriller directly to your DS!\n\nThe first game in the series crafted specifically for the DS, Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney puts you in charge of title character Apollo Justice at the outset of his legal career. Controlling the game almost exclusively by pointing and clicking on the DS Touch Screen, you must guide Apollo through an investigation phase before defending clients in the courtroom. During the investigation phase you gather evidence by interviewing witnesses and scouring crime scenes for clues. After you\u2019ve built a case, you must stand before a judge and defend the innocence of your client by cross-examining witnesses and revealing your findings. Whichever case you are working on, you can expect to become immersed in the deep and entertaining storylines that have become a trademark of the Ace Attorney games.\n\nAs well as introducing Apollo, the game marks the arrival of several more fascinating characters to the series. There\u2019s Apollo\u2019s assistant; the young magician Trucy, who\u2019s mysterious powers can help you to tell when a witness is giving false evidence. There are also brothers Klavier and Kristoph Gavin \u2013 one a rock star and ace prosecutor and the other a level-headed lawyer who is always on hand with helpful tips for Apollo. On top of that, you\u2019ll cross paths with the star of the previous Ace Attorney games, Phoenix Wright, in the most dramatic of circumstances!\n\nIn some of the toughest cases in the Ace Attorney series yet, you\u2019ll have to unravel multi-layered mysteries, defend more seemingly in-defensible causes and even persuade a jury of your client\u2019s innocence for the first time. And, as fans of the series know, no Ace Attorney game would be complete without the ability to intervene in proceedings by yelling \u201cObjection!\u201d or \u201cHold it!\u201d into the DS microphone. So brush up on your legal skills and prepare for the bar to be raised as you seek the truth in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.\n\nTake control of rookie lawyer Apollo Justice as he investigates crimes and defends seemingly hopeless clients in the courtroom.Lose yourself in dramatic and amusing storylines, and meet colourful characters who may help or hinder you in your quest for the truth.Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is the first game in the series developed specifically for Nintendo DS.",

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \n\nFEATURES:\n\n Procedurally Generated Dungeons\n Roguelike Mode for fans of extreme challenge\n 70+ different types of monsters, with different traits and custom mechanics\n Xbox and Steam controller support\n Dungeons & Streamers - Twitch and Mixer integration\n Monthly and all-time Leaderboards, 200+ Achievements\n\nBook of Demons is the first installment of Return 2 Games - a series of original mid-core titles, inspired by the early golden days of PC gaming.\n\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\nIt\u2019s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\n\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\n\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\n\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book.\nIt\u2019s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\n\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\n\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.\n",

Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!\n\nMAIN CHARACTERS\n\nGal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She\u2019s an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don\u2019t have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.\n\nRicardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He\u2019s not very fast and his technique isn\u2019t as good as his comrades\u2019, but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He\u2019s capable of destroying any enemy in record time!\n\nF. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He\u2019s the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as \u201cthe forbidden technique\u201d. While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.",

It\u2019s going to be different, because it\u2019s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let\u2019s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other\u2019s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out \u2013 the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone \u2013 they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That\u2019s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.\n\nWhat makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities \u2013 she can run fast, he can sneak \u2013 but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities.

But it's not all good news; the tyrant Heavenly Peter has escaped your clutches, and you have been tasked with the mission of finding him...\n\nYour journey will take you through a richly detailed landscape built from hundreds of different Renaissance paintings. You will steal a ship, feed a donkey, compete in a talent contest, assist an inept street magician, sing, dance, play the (magic?) flute, poke a man's face, hunt for treasure and have a chat with Our Lord God Almighty... But will you find Heavenly Peter? And if you do, how will you take your revenge!?\n\nFEATURES\n\nPointing and Clicking \u2013 A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.\n\nRenaissance Artwork \u2013  Paintings by Rembrandt, Botticelli, Michelangelo and many more are brought together into one consistent world, in a way that is also as sympathetic as possible to the original works.\n\nClassical Music \u2013 a soundtrack selected to fit with the style of the artwork. Music from classical composers such as Vivaldi, Bach and George Frideric Handel will accompany you on your journey. \n\nStandalone Story - The Procession to Calvary is set in the same world as Four Last Things, but it's story can be played independently.\n\nOptional Murder \u2013 You will be equipped with a sword. This will become useful in a number of different situation, but you will be strongly discouraged from using it on people. Ignoring this advice - and murdering anyone who stands in your way \u2013 will serve as a useful method of skipping any puzzles you don't like. But be warned; your actions might come back to haunt you...\n\nNonsense \u2013 A style of humour reminiscent of the surreal, anarchic comedy of Monty Python. Lofty subject matter is treated with refreshing flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)\n\nMoments of Surprising Profundity \u2013 Actually, no... Don't read too much into it.",

What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?\n\nExplore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:\nCan\u2019t reach a collectible?

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \n\nFEATURES:\n\n Procedurally Generated Dungeons\n Roguelike Mode for fans of extreme challenge\n 70+ different types of monsters, with different traits and custom mechanics\n Xbox and Steam controller support\n Dungeons & Streamers - Twitch and Mixer integration\n Monthly and all-time Leaderboards, 200+ Achievements\n\nBook of Demons is the first installment of Return 2 Games - a series of original mid-core titles, inspired by the early golden days of PC gaming.\n\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\nIt\u2019s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\n\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\n\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\n\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book.\nIt\u2019s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\n\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\n\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.\n",

Build a bad-ass gun from thousands of combinations then get ready to duck and dodge your way through a shit-ton of bullets in this nostalgic \u2013 and nerve-wracking \u2013 VR Bullet Hell shooter for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\n\nYou'll need to physically duck, dodge, twist, and turn your way through hundreds of bullets. We scale the action dynamically to make use of the space you have available, so the more you move around the better!\n\nLike in a traditional bullet hell game, the key to success is finding the 'sweet spot' to be in while the onslaught of bullets flies toward you. The only thing that can take damage in Blasters is your head. When you see a circle of bullets, often the best thing to do is to keep your head right in the middle and let the bullets breeze right by you.\n\nYou can also block bullets with your shield as a last resort, but it's impossible to block everything. Avoidance is the best strategy, so start moving around your play-space and dodge those bullets!\n\nYou will encounter a variety of enemies within Blasters that you need to dispatch. From fast moving ground enemies, to agile flying enemies, and deadly lumbering tanks. Each enemy will pose a different threat level to you, so you'll need to quickly identify what enemies are the most important to destroy first.\n\nBlasters of the Universe features a 4 level Campaign for you to battle through, each ending with an epic boss battle. In each level, you'll battle new enemies, unlock new weapon parts and shields, and work your way towards glory. Each level also features an Endless Mode where you can fight for a high score on the leaderboards.\n\nAs you progress through the levels, you'll unlock new weapon parts to take into battle. You can build a custom weapon that suits your play style and the challenges you face. Want a super-fast firing hit-scan weapon that deals poison damage to enemies? No problem. What about a scatter-shot cannon that deals explosive damage and arcs shots towards nearby enemies? Can do. With tens of thousands of unique combinations to choose from, you have the ability to create a weapon that perfectly suits your style.\n\nThe Frame is the core of every gun. Each Frame in Blasters has a unique special ability that you can unleash to deal devastation to the enemies attacking you and help turn the tides during an intense battle.\n\nThese specials range from a bad-ass giant laser that melts anything it hits to a time-bubble that slows everything down and gives you the upper hand for dodging incoming bullets. Each special is unique and has different strengths that you can use to your advantage.\n\nConstantly updating Challenge modes with unique gameplay ensure there is something new and exciting to play every day. Compete for the top score in Time Attack, Endless, and Speed-run challenges that push you to play in unique and difficult ways.",

It\u2019s going to be different, because it\u2019s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let\u2019s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other\u2019s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out \u2013 the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone \u2013 they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That\u2019s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.\n\nWhat makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities \u2013 she can run fast, he can sneak \u2013 but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there\u2019s nothing in the world that can stop you.\n\nFeatures:\n\nA moving story about friendship and love in dangerous times\n\nBeautiful, sketch-like graphics inspired by na\u00efve art\n\nPair mechanics: take control of two characters with different skills and abilities, or control them as a pair\n\nA grotesque tale mixed with bittersweet humor\n\nThe events shown in the game are based on actual stories from war\n\nA dialogue system built around the language of symbolic pictures\n\nVarious logical puzzles in 2.5D\n\nA story that offers deeper meaning, set in historical realities",

Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths \u2013 no matter the cost to mind and body.\n\nThe Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests \u2013Richet\u2019s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\n\nIn a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council\u2019s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character\u2019s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean \u2018game over\u2019, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player\u2019s adventure.\n\nRichet\u2019s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council\u2019s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.",

Introducing Flashpoints: high-stakes, branching short stories that link together mercenary missions, crew conversations, special events, critical choices, and rare bonus rewards to take BATTLETECH's endgame and Career-Mode gameplay to the next level. \n\nFlashpoints embroil you in the feuds and machinations of the various Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, and are designed to keep even the most hardened mercenary commanders on their toes. In addition to narrative twists and turns, some Flashpoint stories feature consecutive deployments in which players can\u2019t repair or heal between missions, while others feature infiltration contracts that restrict the tonnage of deployable BattleMechs.  \n\nBeyond adding over 30 hours of exciting Flashpoints to BATTLETECH, this expansion comes complete with three new \u2018Mechs (including the highly anticipated Hatchetman), a challenging new mission type, and a new tropical biome for the biggest and most challenging BATTLETECH experience yet.\n\nFLASHPOINTS\nHere's just a few examples of the many new stories and challenges you'll face as a mercenary commander in Flashpoint:\n\nExtracurricular Activities \nThe petty squabbling of political rivals takes a deadly turn when civilians are caught in the crossfire. Will you escort them to safety at the risk of your MechWarriors and their 'Mechs\u2026 even if they can't pay?\n\nCriminal Minds\nThe routine capture of a criminal syndicate\u2019s warehouse uncovers the resting place of an ancient BattleMech. Will you share this information with your employer or keep the \u2018Mech for yourself? \n\nHeadhunting\nThe Zhao twins are a thorn in the side of your employer and it\u2019s time to terminate their command. But when their forces are routed and the siblings flee in two directions you\u2019ll need to choose which commander - and which unique salvage - you\u2019ll pursue.\n\nNEW BATTLEMECHS\nExpand your 'Mech arsenal with the armor-chopping power of the Hatchetman, the speed and versatility of the Crab, and the battle-computer-equipped Cyclops.\n\nNEW ENCOUNTER\nTarget Acquisition is an exciting new mission type that challenges you to put your light and medium 'Mechs to the test. Take control of three locations to triangulate fire on an enemy installation before time runs out.\n\nNEW BIOME\nTake the fight to all-new lush, tropical environments - but watch out for the spore clouds (or use them to your advantage!)",

From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early;\n - Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you\u2019re only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you;\n - A grim world plunged in half-darkness. In this world, our god has finally turned his back on us and his corrupt presence can change the intensity of the battlefield. From summoning monsters, through changing the weather, to transforming one of the creatures into a powerful avatar of his will;\n - A vagabond\u2019s exploration system. Travel the world bringing your mobile base along with you. Take shelter in and manage your camp, but be wary of enemy ambushes;\n - A unique fusion of dark Victorian fantasy and wild west. Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nAlder's Blood is a dark, stealth, tactical game with the turn-based combat focused on avoiding enemy ambushes and setting up your own. Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay.\n\nManage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival.\n\nMonsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it.\n\nMonsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will.\n\nHunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used.\n\nAnd smaller ones, better for stealth actions.\n\nWithin their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.\n\nIn addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp.\n\nRemember, this is not the world you know.\n\nThis is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology.\n\nYour resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.\n\n",

The object of each level is to defeat all of the enemies in the room (if any) and reach the goal. However, the terrain is invisible to the player. The player can discover terrain by physically bumping into it, or by performing a double jump. The double jump sprays paint bullets out of the player and increases the player\u2019s awareness of their surroundings. If the player happens to bump into spikes or falls to their death, paint will also shoot out from the player\u2019s last position. The room isn\u2019t wiped clean after death so that the player has an easier time navigating after multiple attempts!",

In the morning, they wake up with no recollection of what happened or where they were.\n\nIT TOOK YOUR FRIEND. THEY SAY IT'S NOT REAL\nSome teenagers in this town woke up during a few of these \"Blackouts\" themselves, finding themselves in the woods or on train tracks with no idea how they got there. When they tell their parents, their teachers, the police... no one believes them. Taking matters into their own hands, they formed a club - The Blackout Club - to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately, the recent disappearance of a close friend means that the sleepwalking isn't just strange - it could be deadly.\n\nIT WALKS AMONG THEM\nYou and your friends must team up to overcome the powerful forces that are arrayed against you. Using tools such as drones, noisemakers, and grappling hooks, you will outwit and outmaneuver the adults while attempting to obtain and record evidence that will prove what is happening to the rest of the world. With procedural elements that change goals, enemies, loot and more, no two nights in the neighborhood will be the same.\n\nGAMEPLAY FEATURES\n\nA Modern Horror Setting To Explore: A beautiful and modern neighborhood full of houses, woods, and a very mysterious subterranean network of tunnels.\n\nCooperative Gameplay: Drop-in/Drop-out multiplayer sessions for 1-4 players. \n\nEach Night A New Adventure: Missions are procedurally-generated and vary according to player level and progress. Enemy Patrols, Loot Placement, Mission Objectives, Environmental Obstacles, and other aspects of each night's mission are never the same twice for a high amount of replayability.\n\nRichly-Simulated World Supporting Many Play Styles: Players have the freedom to go through the game at their own pace and choose the paths they take through the world. Experiment with different abilities and items to find creative solutions to any problem. \n\nA Deep Mystery Under The Surface: Though we are a small team, we have decades of AAA experience from before we went independent, and our last game The Magic Circle has won awards for its story and narrative. That being said... with The Blackout Club, we have a few new tricks up our sleeve we think are going to surprise even the most veteran horror game fans.\n\nCharacter Growth & Customization: Players get to create their own character and customize them by unlocking new clothing, gestures, and hairstyles. As players level up they will also unlock new expansion slots and upgrade their abilities.\n\nAn Unseen Threat: If players are not careful and draw too much attention to themselves, The Shape will come for them. You'll need to stick together and look out for one another while it hunts you down. There's one catch... You can only see The Shape by closing your eyes.\nTOGETHER, WE CAN FIND HER.

    "description": "Espire 1: VR Operative aims to set the new gold standard for the stealth genre in virtual reality \u2013introducing the \u201cControl Theatre,\u201d a unique solution to the challenge of VR motion sickness for first-person titles. Espire 1: VR Operative drafts players as drone operators of the future. Players become \u201cEspire Agents\u201d and use cutting-edge Virtual Reality hardware to remote-operate the Espire model 1 from the safety of their Control Theatre.\n\nThe technology behind the Control Theatre and the game\u2019s approach to movement lie at the heart of Espire 1: VR Operative\u2019s gameplay and intuitive VR control system. Any time a player performs any artificial locomotion, the game world shrinks down to the size of a floating tablet, with the Control Theatre visible in the player\u2019s peripheral vision. This \u201cVR within VR\u201d system allows for precise, full freedom movement, while maintaining immersion, and eliminating \u201cVR motion sickness\u201d for almost everyone. The Control Theatre is fully customizable to suit the player\u2019s level of comfort, and can be fully disabled for those already comfortable moving in VR.\n\nEspire 1: VR Operative Key Features Include:\n\n* The definitive VR stealth experience: bringing the stealth genre to the exciting medium of Virtual Reality, delivering gameplay mechanics for the stealth and action genres that have yet to be explored.\n\n* Full freedom of movement: allowing players the freedom to move anywhere within their virtual environment, moving, climbing, and falling with full comfort and no motion sickness for almost all players.\n\n* Complete single-player story, rich in detail: developed as a dedicated single player VR experience with individual story missions and scenario missions that use the story mission environments for short challenges.\n\n* Voice control: Using the VR headset\u2019s onboard microphone, players can make commands and perform actions simply by speaking. The noises players make can draw the enemy to their location \u2013 adding a new way to gain the advantage.\n\n* Arsenal of weapons and gadgets: As an Espire model 1 Operative, players will have access to dozens of unique gadgets and weapons such as a tranquilizer pistol and deployable spy cameras in order to complete the mission objectives.\n\n* Global Leaderboard: A worldwide tally awards players a competitive score based on mission time, movement, stealth, ammo conservation, takedowns and other factors.\n\n* Intuitive controls that mimic real life: Interaction in this game aims to be natural and intuitive. Instead of memorizing dozens of button combinations for every action, players perform them as they would in real life. Operatives can crouch and enter cover by physically using their body.\n\n* Smart AI: Enemy combatants in this game actively hunt the player. The AI responds to sight, sound, and other stimuli and will react to with varying levels of suspicion based on the player\u2019s physical stance, movement speed, cover and relative location.",

Ancient warrior machines spawn from Golem Gates while an unseen force compels you to take up arms. Wielding the power hidden within \u2018The Ash\u2019, you\u2019ll battle the golems and unravel the mysteries surrounding their long-lost creators.\n\nGolem Gates blends elements of real-time strategy (RTS) and card battle. Collect cards (called Glyphs) containing your forces and powers. Strategically weave them into a deck to prepare for battle, then create them on the field to defeat your enemies in fast-paced and highly tactical battles with streamlined management to keep focus on the action. Play singleplayer or multiplayer in local matches with bots, online matches with other players, single and co-op Survival, solo challenge scenarios and a full single player campaign.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nDynamic Diversity: 100 Glyphs provide the options for your strategy: Units, buildings, traps, buffs, debuffs, and techs. Create your own unique battle plan and counter your opponents'. Randomized drawing puts a slightly different spin on every battle - eliminating monotonous build sequences, rewarding deckbuilding skill and strategic planning in equal measure.\n\nStreamlined Strategy: Build your forces and enhance them with Glyphs; no production or research buildings needed. Capture resources in King of the Hill style without dedicated gathering units. Keep your focus where it belongs: on the battle.\n\nFight Where You Have Sight: Glyphs can be played almost anywhere you have an existing presence. Add more forces to a battle to turn the tide, transform a scouting party into an army, place emergency defenses to respond to the enemy, or hide an outpost in a direction the enemy doesn't expect. The choices are yours, but beware: the enemy will do the same and with the right Glyph your forces can be destroyed as fast as they were created.",

After a violent plane crash, Stanley must search a desolate frozen island in search of his wife Leonore while covering up any traces of their identity.  Rescue help is on the way, the past must remain hidden. \"They can't find out who we are!\"\n\nInspirations include Dear Esther, Gone Home and Firewatch as well as dark character dramas like as Homeland, Lost, and The Americans. \n\nThe Fidelio Incident was also inspired by Beethoven's only opera,  Fidelio.  We use the opera's premise as inspiration for the backstory, then re-imagined it for a modern setting.\n\nMichael Krikorian's score composes over 40 minutes of original music.  He incorporates themes from Fidelio's overture and transforms them to fit the mood and atmosphere of the game.  The score expands the emotional depth of the narrative while complementing the atmosphere of the island.  \n\nStanley is played by Glenn Keogh, known for his roles in Transformers Age of Extinction, Once Upon A Time, and Sons of Anarchy.  Glenn was born in Ireland.  After reading the script, he signed on with the goal of bringing authenticity to Stanley's character.  We think he did a great job, and hope you agree!\n\nLeonore is played by Bess Harrison, whose credits include The Temple and Memory, for Amazon Studios.  Bess is described by Glenn as having a sweetheart voice you can't help but fall in love with.  \n\nThe game runs on Unreal Engine 4.",

Players with less violent intent can find secret paths to complete Mable without killing anything, including bosses. \n\nUnlike most Metroidvanias Mable does not allow you to run, jump and kill on your own. Instead, you must use non-human forms to attack creatures and traverse through difficult challenges. \n\nThe strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it.

Send out soundwaves to reveal your surroundings briefly before they fade into darkness.

In this test of skill, strategy and teamwork players will band together with up to three friends on a variety of missions, securing supplies as well as survivors to strengthen their camp against the threat of both the dead and the living - by any means necessary.\n\nA New Story Within the World of The Walking Dead. In OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead, players are introduced to Aidan, Maya, Grant and Heather; four people brought together by necessity and the willingness to do whatever it takes to stay alive in a post-apocalyptic world. Inspired by the rich story universe of Robert Kirkman\u2019s original graphic novels, OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead sheds light on some of the events that take place in Washington D.C.\n\nWelcome to the Wasteland of Washington D.C. Explore the capital after the outbreak, and discover what happened. Journey through the districts of the desolate city, and search lost neighborhoods such as Georgetown for loot, supplies and other survivors. Tread lightly, as any noise can be heard by both the dead and the living, and any mistake runs the risk of attracting a horde of walkers.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nImprovise, Adapt, Overcome. In a world where everything has stopped working, players will have to make do with what they find. The post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead is a harsh place to live in, let alone find things that work. As players loot the city for supplies, they will come to understand that weapons and ammunition are scarce and their condition vary. If not maintained, guns will jam as you pull the trigger, silencers will break, and old sights will challenge your skills as you take aim.\n\nHome Is Where Your Camp Is. You won\u2019t always have to go looking for trouble, it will also find you. Defend your camp against roaming hordes of walkers when they lock on to your camp. Strengthen your defenses, and take on waves of walkers while keeping the other camp members safe.\n\nThink. Fight. Live. Each playable character comes with a unique skill tree, squad role, play style and background story. They all share a common objective, where survival and teamwork is paramount. The action is up-close and intense: take out enemies carefully with silent melee attacks, or go in guns blazing. You need to be able to improvise, as nothing is certain and a horde of walkers will always be right around the corner.\n\nThe Story Continues. Development on OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead will continue after release, offering players new storylines to experience, new places to explore, new weapons to use, and much more. The post-launch campaign is built around OVERKILL Software\u2019s philosophy of constantly evolving a game together with the community. \n\nPowered by Unreal Technology. Capturing the dark and moody universe of Robert Kirkman\u2019s The Walking Dead in stunning detail, the Unreal Engine offers players the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in a highly-detailed rendition of The Walking Dead universe. Experience hundreds of horrifying walkers on-screen in a way that will get your heart pounding. \n\nFrom The Makers of PAYDAY. OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead is made by OVERKILL Software, the developers of PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2. OVERKILL is a blend of industry veterans, freshly graduated specialists and great partners. Our passion is to create kick-ass cooperative action games together with our community.

The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.\n\nThe Frontlines game mode is unique in its tactical complexity. The realistic trenches are challenging to fight in and require tactical cunning to capture and defend. The Entente and Central Powers strive to gain control of frontline sectors. In one battle you\u2019ll find yourself rushing the enemy trenches during an offensive action in order to gain ground, while in another you might be defending your recently conquered ground against a fierce enemy counter-attack.\n\nPlayers can choose to be part of one of the many squad types in the game, each of which have their own distinct tactical roles. By working together with your friends, you can earn experience that improves the power and versatility of your squad. As you gain more experience fighting and get promoted in rank, you also earn Career Points which you can use to unlock specializations, weapons and equipment.",

One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels including a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets.\n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. Some traps can be avoided only if time moves slower than usual, thanks to yet another special ability. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!\n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Unique gameplay due to alternative reality levels and time warp feature\n - Varied game mechanics \n - Grayscale graphic with original \u201cold horror\u201d camera effects \n - Enigmatic story reminiscent of dark fairy tales \n - Beautiful minimal soundtrack \n - 21 levels full of disturbing story",

Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded.\n\nTravel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters.\n\n\nThe souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..?\n\nGather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward.

If it's high \u2014 expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly.\n\n\n\nEvery crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking!\n\n\n\nLegends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners.\n\nA dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life.\n\nThis region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them.\n\nNow regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison...\n\nTruth be told, no one has attempted this before.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/760080/Hazardous_Space/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/921800/Encased_A_SciFi_PostApocalyptic_RPG/",

Humankind is just a small part of a hostile universe. Want to survive? Discover its secrets.   \n   \nA planet in the distant future. A rock floating in space that is no longer what it had once been. Without human interference, nature has been adapting to the new conditions, reclaiming what was once taken away. In its pursuit of perfection, it began to assimilate with the abandoned technology giving life to biomechanical beings.   \n   \nLeft to its own devices, man-made technology has also changed as it tried to adjust to the new environment. A strong symbiosis soon developed between technology and nature. It became difficult to determine what is alive and what is mechanical in the world of Inner Chains.   \n   \nAfter several million years of biomechanical evolution, mankind once again became an important part of the ecosystem. However, it hasn\u2019t regained an advanced stage of development. As a result, the human race, oblivious to its own history, cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planet\u2019s resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith, dominance, oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes, and, in consequence, to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first, learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit.  \n\nAs one of the inhabitants of this world, your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated, dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal, but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival, face hostile fauna and flora, and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the game\u2019s world. Your survival depends entirely on your watchfulness, logical judgment, quick reflexes, accuracy and the ability to use the environment to your advantage.",

Each of the Jiuquan possess supernatural powers, and each are a fountain of energy and life for the universe.  In the War of the Three Tribes, the Beasts were defeated by the coalition of Humans and Gods. The tribe of the Beasts retreated to the Demon World and since then Gods, Demons and Men have lived in isolation. After the war, Shen Nong and the Jiuquan disappeared from the world, and as time flowed on\u2026 the legend of the Jiuquan was lost.\n\n\u3000\u3000Yue Jinzhao and Yue Qi arrive in the West Side, searching for something they had lost -- what they will find instead is an ancient secret uncovered. Elsewhere, a gargantuan slumbering beast awakens in the sea -- soaring to the skies, and bewildered at the voice in its head.\n\n\u3000\u3000In the martial world, factions struggle for control: True Martial Alliance, Risen Soul Saints, Hengdao Society and the demonic Piscis\u2026 who are the true masterminds behind the traps within traps, the devious plans and evil designs? Destinies will unfold and become undone, as sacrifices are made\u2026 in the celebration of life.\n\nFEATIRES:\n\n[Dual Combat System]\uff1afeatures a fusion of real-time and turn-based dual combat modes, with both modes able to be freely selected by players.\n\n[Combat Formations]\uff1aadds more variety to enemy battles. In normal combat, players can control one character, and use formations to execute skills to break through enemy defense or deal damage. Players can go commands for such things as a focused attack, priority to heal, etc. There are also special modes such as aerial fights and ranged shooting.\n\n[Difficulty ]\uff1aEasy, Normal and Hard difficulties are available for selection. Hard difficulty will be available after the first playthrough. Players can also lower the difficulty during gameplay -- once the difficulty is lowered, it can not be changed. (Players who lower their difficulty can not challenge the Hard final boss in their first playthrough.)\n\n[Charged Attack]\uff1afeatures a new special attack system. Using MP accumulated during battle, players can use either \u201cTechnique,\u201d\u201cHarmony,\u201dor \u201cSlash\u201d Charged Attacks and turn the tide of battle!\n\n[Surprise Attack]\uff1aplayers can surpised attack enemies during combat encounters. Players will deal surprise attack damage based on the difference between player and enemy levels. If the party leader is of a much higher level than the average level of the enemies, a surprise attacks can even be an instant victory, without going into battle.\n\n[Scenario Battles]\uff1aDuring scenario Boss fights, combat can occur directly after the cutscene ends, without switching modes or going into an encounter screen. This is a new storytelling mechanic introduced for the first time in the series.\n\n[Exploration Jumps]\uff1aCharacters can freely explore the map, seeking out secret spots and paths. Maps and stages are larger and have more vertical space than ever before, with mysterious items waiting to be found. These items not only have special effects, but also increase player reputation, which can be used to exchange costumes and titles.\n\n[Weapon Transmogrify]\uff1aplayers can mold the appearance of their weapons to their desire. Players will be able to change the look of their weapon to another that they already have, while the basic stats of the weapon remain unaffected. As the weapons are shown in real-time in the game, players dictate not only the fashion, but also how their battles and skills look during combat.\n\n[Reputation]\uff1aawarded by completing quests from NPCs, items can be exchaged with different factions if the reputation requirements are met. Faction-specific items can be exchanged with especially high reputation.\n\n[Meridian System]\uff1aEach character in the game has 3 souls, with their own different attributes. Players can customize the characters by choosing different attributes in those souls. Each node selected has different effects, and special hidden effects may be found if the right nodes are selected.\n\n[Event Mini-games]\uff1avarious mini-games are scattered throughout the game. Puzzles, traps and games can be played using character-specific stage skills. With the free exploration that the game world offers, players can discover hidden events, and possible even find secret items.\n\n[Stage Skills]\uff1aEach of the six main characters have their own \u201cstage skills\u201d that can be used. Players will need to utilize these skills to overcome certain puzzle and traps. Yue Jinzhao\u2019s \u201cFlight of Sword\u201d allows players to fly over obstacles to reach places impossible to travel to otherwise.",

You might get stuck on some puzzles, but you should never not know what you need to do to proceed.\n\nSo what do you actually do? Well, you search around and solve puzzles, and as you do so you'll be developing a scene in front of you and hearing a story. I want to the story to really stand out, so the game has got really beautiful pixel art and top notch music, combined with gameplay and narrative beats that individually would do a pretty good job of telling that story, but come together to really make something special.\n\nIt's a pretty short game too. I would say just over three hours. There are loads of games these days and who has time to play them all? I've tried to keep things as condensed as possible rather than add filler, to be as respectful for your time as I can be.\n\nEach story is in a different setting and has completely different gameplay mechanics. It ended up being a LOT of work, but It's kind of necessary: The gameplay itself has a hand in telling the story, so what works for one tale wouldn't work for another.\n\nI don't think there's anything else like it out there, so if nothing else, It should give you a unique experience.\n\nSo yeah.

You might get stuck on some puzzles, but you should never not know what you need to do to proceed.\n\nSo what do you actually do? Well, you search around and solve puzzles, and as you do so you'll be developing a scene in front of you and hearing a story. I want to the story to really stand out, so the game has got really beautiful pixel art and top notch music, combined with gameplay and narrative beats that individually would do a pretty good job of telling that story, but come together to really make something special.\n\nIt's a pretty short game too. I would say just over three hours. There are loads of games these days and who has time to play them all? I've tried to keep things as condensed as possible rather than add filler, to be as respectful for your time as I can be.\n\nEach story is in a different setting and has completely different gameplay mechanics. It ended up being a LOT of work, but It's kind of necessary: The gameplay itself has a hand in telling the story, so what works for one tale wouldn't work for another.\n\nI don't think there's anything else like it out there, so if nothing else, It should give you a unique experience.\n\nSo yeah.

Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents\u2019 identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your adoptive country? Or will you strike out on your own, turning against both your homeland and your adoptive country to shape a destiny for yourself? Love is all you need\u2026and also improvised firearms.\n\nFour Horsemen is not another hagiographic, pioneer-tradition, self-exotifying immigrant explainer about being slightly different. It is an exploration of human migration in terms of people\u2013neither as mythology nor as political platform, but as a difficult decision made by ordinary human beings caught in impossible circumstances, with consequences that ripple for generations. This isn\u2019t a game about finding yourself\u2026it\u2019s a game about your self finding you.\n\nDrawing from real lived experience, interviews with current and former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking anthropological research, featuring 4 different main storylines, 9 different endings, 12 different playable homelands (all of which play differently), and a multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen tells a powerfully compelling, heartrendingly familiar, brutally honest story about what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours, but you\u2019ll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the game has to tell\u2026and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your own.\n\nEXCITING BULLET POINTS!!\n\nYOUR DECISIONS MATTER. Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well.\n\nNO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE. Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant, you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt.\n\nNOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE. No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some questions there are no right answers--only different consequences.\n\nDELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM. Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home! Dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from your terrible day job, and make DIY versions of things you could never afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to immigrants...\n\nTRIUMPH OVER HATE. A stranger pulls a knife on you and screams at you to leave town--what do you do? Do you try to de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our combat system replicates the anxiety and terror of real violence, not a power fantasy.\n\nTHE MOST ADVANCED PROFANITY SYSTEM IN A VIDEO GAME, EVER.

Later that year while awaiting his trial, Samuel hung himself in his cell. Some cheered, for in their minds he was a monster, destined for Hell.

Each Astellian is charged with protecting the innocents of the world, a task that will take them through the darkest dungeons and across countless battlefields. Take up the Hero's Mantle and let your grand adventure begin; Astellia boasts a wide variety of unique and diverse dungeons, both for the solo player as well as parties, that reward those adventurers based on how well they perform. What better way to test your hard earned dungeoneering rewards than to take them to the arena? Arenas in Astellia offer both cooperative and competitive styles; whether you want to team up with your friends to fight hordes of monsters or go toe to toe against your fellow Astellians, the Coliseum will always provide for your competitive needs.\n\nFor those, both bold and brave enough to crave more, the field of Avalon awaits your glorious conquest. Avalon is the grand battlefield where three factions clash and vie for dominance. To claim victory you must be prepared to raise an army, fight strategically, and commit your full military might in order to overcome your adversaries.\n\nAll of these elements and so much more combine to bring the world of Astellia to life, all it is missing is your story.

    "description": "SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are happy to announce that the latest entry in the RGG / Yakuza series, Yakuza: Like a Dragon (Japanese title - Ryu Ga Gotoku 7) is releasing in Japan on January 16, 2020, for the PlayStation\u00ae4, with a Western launch planned for 2020. Actors Shinichi Tsutsumi, Ken Yasuda, and Kiichi Nakai will be lending their appearances and voices to the game\u2019s main cast members, with Kazuhiro Nakaya voicing the game\u2019s main protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga. \n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon introduces a new main protagonist for the first time since the series\u2019 inception over a decade ago \u2014 Ichiban Kasuga, a low-level yakuza member looking to prove his self-worth, and follows him and his motley crew of unlikely allies as they attempt to rise from rags to riches in this modern human drama. \n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon is much more than just a new chapter in the Yakuza series. Much like the new English title itself, Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a complete reimagining of the franchise, a landmark to coincide with the series\u2019 15th anniversary. With the bulk of the game taking place in the large-scale, painstakingly-realized setting of Ijincho in Yokohama, players will explore an entirely new side of Japan never-before-seen in the series. Not only that, but Yakuza: Like a Dragon\u2019s combat system has undergone a major overhaul, combining Yakuza\u2019s established brawling action with a turn-based RPG battle system.",

Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.\n\nIn an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.\n\nNOTE FOR LINUX USERS - Due to game engine limitations we are only able to guarantee compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64bit or newer.

We very much want to support the Linux community and are happy to entertain suggestions on how we may improve compatibility in the future.\n\nGAME PLAY:\n\n-Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you net!\n\n-Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful \"Risk Shots\". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!\n\n-Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space & modify your attack!\n\n-Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!\n\n-Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and utilize \"Risk Shots\" to string together combos and increase your score multiplier!\n\n-Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance and actions taken during missions!",

Novelists and poets like Pasolini, Galeano, Soriano, Hornby, Saba, Handke, Wenders have written about football and its evocative and poetic power. Same in movies, with fringe and beautiful works like The Lost World Cup or Wender's The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick. Another great inspiration was the book Football Clich\u00e9s by Adam Hurrey. \nThis naturally lead to the question: why people love football so much? \nSo we started designing a new, unique game around football, as we believe games can be a wonderful media for storytelling.\n\nA VERY SMALL TEAM\nIf you\u2019re thinking about buying Football Drama please keep in mind that we are a very passionate but small team of three - and totally self-funded by working in parallel on games for customers. This is not a blockbuster experience with many hours of content. Also if you are concerned about the price difference between Steam and mobile, we believe the right price is the one on Steam, but we are (way, way) weaker than market forces so we had to oblige.

In actuality, Tris is immortal, and has lived centuries moving from town to town in order to leave any suspicions behind him. He also has a remarkable ability: a healing touch which he similarly refrains from using, lest he be labelled a witch.\n\nBut when love comes knocking, it\u2019s hard to keep cautious. After revealing his powers to save the life of his partner Alasdair, Tris finds himself at risk of exposure \u2013 both as someone with supernatural gifts, and as a man who loves other men.\n\nBy noose or by carriage, Tris is leaving Inverness.\n\nIf he flees, Tris will lose everything and be left destitute on the streets, but if he stays to earn enough to start a new life, he risks the gallows. Fortunately, at that moment a woman in dubious clothes with an equally dubious background approaches him requesting an expensive commission.\n\nThree paths lead forward. Should Tris try to mend his fractured relationship with Alasdair, seek help from his enigmatic client, or dive headlong into work to fund his escape?\n\nHelp him find his way through his last Inverness nights.",

This is our first released game. True retro. The original game of 1999, no remake. Excellent voice acting from the famous Czech actor J\u00ed\u0159\u00ed L\u00e1bus. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0529432/\n\nSTORY\nSeverin is a young monk, who was sound sleeping, while some claustral disciples were disporting with adult literature. When he awakes and actually takes the erotic scripture from the boys, he himself is accused by his abbot of the worst sins. The abbot doesn't hesitate long - we are in the dark Middle Ages - trying to behead the 'devil's minion'. Severin can only save his life by a dauntless jump out of the window (he puts his Rambo scarf on for that). While he is lying unconsciously on the ground, he - like already before - dreams strange dreams, which want to bring him somehow on the road of insight about the meaning of life... \n\nWhen he awakes, he finds himself in a forest without a notion, what to do next, but absolutely determined to fathom the sense of life and find his way. How he will keep track of the question of all questions with shrewdness, curiosity, mother wit and a thick skin and what will be the result, we will experience in this adventure game.\n\nSUMMARY\nIn the Raven Shadow is in the best sense an old-fashioned adventure game for all sense-seeking people, which can laugh about themselves. And not only the painting in the decayed house does show a twinkle of the eye. The game is made for all those, who don't want to be taken firmly by the hand in the way: here is a hotspot - interact with it, but more: here are many possibilities - think! The puzzles are of medium difficulty. Severin's story runs error free. It will amuse and entertain the gamers for about 20+ hours.",

It takes a deep understanding of your own weight, thrust, and inertia in order to be a master Particle Mace gladiator, but once you get in the zone, this game satisfies like no other.\n\nPARTICLE MACE is a game about capturing the thrill of classic arcade games with a new, physics based mechanic.\n\nPARTICLE MACE is a game about trying not to die, but that's impossible.\n\nPARTICLE MACE is explosive arcade fun for 1-4 players that pays homage to twitch games of the past, but replaces the typical guns with an unruly physics-based weapon. Take control of a tiny ship in an extremely hostile universe, and defend yourself as long as possible from enemy ships and asteroids using a collection of trash particles tethered to the ship. To survive, you must carefully navigate around the many hazards while building up momentum to swing your weapon into your foes or your friends, all in a field of brightly abstracted visuals and an entrancing procedural background.",

In ghost form, the player can fly or pass through walls.

However, he is slowly dying. \n\nThankfully, he meets an old lady (with her own sense of humour) which can help him prepare an antidote - but she needs a special mushroom for it. Even though he finds the mushroom pretty fast in a cave nearby, a very unlucky earthquake occurs, trapping him inside. Will he find his way out? What secrets await him in the cave? Will the cure even work? Or will the cave be too *(g)hostile*?\n\nFind out yourself!",

    "description": "THIS IS NO ARCADE SHOOTER, THIS IS 100% GUN MECHANIC REALISM\nReceiver 2 simulates every internal part of each firearm based on manufacturer schematics and gunsmithing resources. Learn exactly how each sidearm works, including how to load and unload them, clear malfunctions, and operate their safety features.\n\nNOT YOUR ORDINARY FPS\nYou won't find any loot crates or bullet sponges here. Every enemy can be destroyed by a single well-placed shot, using ballistic simulation based on data from shooting incident reconstruction textbooks. Practice the Receiver virtues of resilience, focus, and courage to resist the Threat.\n\nFEATURES\n\nSidearms modeled down to every spring and pin\n\nEnemies with physically-based damage models\n\nBallistic modeling of ricochets, penetration, and bullet drop\n\nTrain your mind to defend against the Mindkill\n\nBecome literate in how guns actually operate\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Receiver?\nWe created the original Receiver game for the \"7-day FPS\" challenge to explore gun handling mechanics, randomized levels, and unordered storytelling. With Receiver 2, we are doubling down on the aspects that made the original stand out: the detailed firearm controls and the tense, surreal atmosphere.\n\nWhy are you so obsessed with guns?\nLove them or hate them, firearms are everywhere in our culture. If you want to understand it then you must understand them as well. While many games include firearms, we felt it was time to have a game that is actually about them.\n\nAre there people or animals to shoot in Receiver?\nWe don't believe so. All our information suggests that the Threat will only dream killdrones to attack you after the Mindkill, but there's no way to be sure.\n\nHow is Receiver 2 different from Receiver 1?\nReceiver 2 has the same basic gameplay structure as the first, but more of everything. There are many more sidearms available in Receiver 2, and while Receiver 1 simulated several moving parts for each gun, Receiver 2 simulates *all* of the moving parts. \n\nDoes Receiver 2 have online multiplayer or VR support?\nNo, Receiver 2 is designed to be a single-player experience played on a monitor with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhat is the Mindkill?\nYou are not yet ready for that knowledge. Only a Receiver who has truly Awakened can understand the nature of the Threat.",

    "description": "Whirlygig is a block building game which consists of 4 unique grids \u2013 Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer.  Blocks move upward in Fall, to the right in Winter, downward in Spring, and to the left in Summer.  Every 5 turns, a new grid is randomly selected as the next grid to play in.\n\nBlock Control:  Blocks can be controlled with keyboard or joystick inputs.  Blocks can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise.  The controls can be updated by the user within the Controls screen.  \n\nGame Levels:  The beginning level of the game is set by the user when selecting the difficulty.  This dictates the speed of the block fall, the movement of the blocks from side-to-side, and the number of points achieved when destroying rows of blocks or activating a special bomb.  Every 10 rows destroyed increases the level as long as the level is greater than the starting difficulty selected by the user.\n\nScoring:  Points are accumulated when 1 to 5 rows of blocks are destroyed, or a bomb is detonated.  The more rows that are destroyed at once or individual pieces blown up, the higher the points earned.  \n\nGame Over:  The game has no timer or restriction on number of levels, lines, or blocks.  The game ends when the block level reaches any of the 4 spawn points.\n\nWhirlygig:  4 destroyed rows at once is called a Whirlygig.  When this is achieved, a bonus piece is created.  The user has 5 turns to destroy this bonus piece to receive a good block that will be stored within the grid for later use.  If the bonus piece is not cleared, the user receives a bad block immediately.  Up to 3 good blocks can be stored in each grid, but only one can be activated in a given turn.  However, good blocks can be activated one after the other, and their spawning is in addition to the 5 standard turns received in the grid.\n\nExtra Long = The extra long good block is 5 pieces high allowing the user to obtain a higher score by destroying 5 rows at once. \nBomb = The bomb good block destroys any piece to the left, right, top, or bottom of the bomb.  The bomb itself is also destroyed in the process.\nSingle = The single good block spawns 3 consecutive single blocks for the user.",

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.\n\nA few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.\n\nIn an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.\n\nNOTE FOR LINUX USERS - Due to game engine limitations we are only able to guarantee compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64bit or newer.  It is likely it will function on many other Linux distributions but it is impossible currently to be 100% sure.  We very much want to support the Linux community and are happy to entertain suggestions on how we may improve compatibility in the future.\n\nGAME PLAY:\n\n-Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy.

The best defense is a risky offense!\n\n-Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space & modify your attack!\n\n-Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!\n\n-Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks!

    "description": "You wake up. A disembodied voice tells you that you have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed a terrible crime in the near future, and - according to this voice - the only way you can escape the loop is to convince your future self of the wrongness of their actions.\n\nIt seems you have no choice but to follow their instructions, but that doesn't mean you should believe everything they say. As you progress in your conversation with your future self, it becomes very apparent that something is amiss. Someone is lying to you. The question is: who? And why?\n\nIf you want to be free, make sure you figure out the truth.\n\nThink carefully. Think strategically.\n\n...and good luck.\n\nFEATURES\n\nMind bending, yet personal story: You are stuck in a time loop with your future self, and are told you have to convince them they were wrong for a crime they committed in the near future. What was their crime? Who trapped you in this loop? And, most importantly, how can you escape?\n\nGameplay mechanics as a puzzle: There is no tutorial. You need to be as convincing as possible when talking to your future self, but figuring out the mechanics of how to achieve this (and figuring out how the time loop affects gameplay) is a puzzle in itself, and an inherent part of the game's challenge.\n\nUnique aesthetics: The game visually harks back to the aesthetics of retro text adventures but repeatedly breaks out of genre norms to shock and surprise.\n\nAtmospheric soundtrack: Varied and memorable chiptune soundtrack. A moody, modern update on 8-bit soundtracks of old.\nYour Future Self is a 1-2 hour long story-driven experimental text adventure with unique conversational mechanics, time loop based gameplay, and a gripping, suspenseful, emotionally charged narrative that touches on politically important topics such as climate change, refugee crises, and mental illness. It harks back to the aesthetics of text-based adventure games whilst deliberately bending the genre into something unique.",

    "description": "How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"\"Contraptions\"\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\n\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\n - Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n - Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\n - Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\n\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGADGETS\n\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.\n\n",

The only thing the three characters have in common is the first person view, which fully immerses the player in every character\u2019s life.\n\nTHEMES\nThe Way of Life tells stories about several serious themes: from euthanasia to the death penalty, from war to love, from bullying to discrimination. Every one of them is tied to the other by the game\u2019s main themes: personal growth and the different ways of perceiving reality.\n\nCHARACTERS\nThe player chooses how to face every experience, so every playthrough can be different depending on what decisions the player takes. The characters are extremely different, both visually and control related. The child sees the world in vibrant colors, eager to explore it, while the adult has a narrower, desaturated view except for the things he really cares about. Control wise, the old man moves slowly, with a shaking camera, to simulate how an elderly person moves; while the child can run and jump freely.\n\nCONTENT\nThe Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION will feature 10 Experiences, 30 Levels and more than 70 Significant Choices. This will let you build your own personal life experience, that will lead you to a choice-dependent ending. Can you face yourself?

    "description": "Path Out is is an autobiographical adventure game that allows the players to experience the journey of Abdullah Karam, a young Syrian artist that escaped the civil war in 2014. Path Out is a tale full of surprises, challenges and paradoxical humor, giving insight in this real-life adventure, on which Abdullah comments through Youtube-style videos in the game. \n\nFeatures:\n\nAutobiographical adventure based on real events\n\nRelive Abdullah's escape from war-torn Syria\n\nAbdullah shares his thoughts in key game point with Youtube-style commentary videos \n\nNeo-orchestral electronica music with oriental influences by Wobblersound\n\nMeticulously researched pixel art style inspired by classic 16-bit games and Syrian art\n\nA unique non-combat & narrative driven experience\nIn this first part of Abdullah's journey, he recalls life before the war, a family decision that led to his departure and the perilous journey from his hometown Hama to the Turkish border through the war-torn Aleppo province. The players follow Abdullah's path, getting to know his life, family and surrounding in a narrative adventure that also contains quests and challenges that are based on real events. The gameplay closely follows narrative classics like To The Moon, adding the bitter flavor of the Syrian war, the violence by soldiers and rebels that the players have to escape and the murderous minefield that have to be navigated during the escape.\n\n\u201cI used to be an average kid - going to school, listening to music, and playing video games... Lots of video games\u201d, says Abdulla, Writer and Graphic Designer of Path Out. \u201cWhen my home turned into a war zone and during my escape I suddenly had to deal with very different circumstances... like spotting landmines or surviving a river ride in an oil barrel while crossing a border. I\u2019m looking forward to be able to share the beginning of my story in Path Out with players around the world\u201d.\n\nDoes the story end here?\nCurrently Path Out only tells the beginning of Abdullah\u2019s escape. Upcoming episodes of Path Out could take players on a journey from Syria through Turkey, Greece and the Balkan until he finally arrives at his destination (and current whereabouts) in Central Europe.\n\nWho made Path Out?\nPath Out is a collaboration between Abdullah Karam, the developers of Causa Creations, Wobblersound and the Austrian-American graphic designer Brian Maine.",

Their only option is to sink deeper and deeper into the cold embrace of horror to face their final choice in that icy darkness: to stay alive or to stay human?\n\nThe story takes place in a quiet, unremarkable village lost among the Siberian forest. The protagonist, Anton, had recently moved there with his family and was almost immediately forced to witness and participate in a chain of unsettling events.\nIt's a place where children go missing. The police are powerless, search teams are combing out the forest, but they find no traces. Why, then, is Anton repeatedly coming across prints, bloodstains, and scraps of clothing? It almost feels like someone is putting up a show just for him.\nHe is haunted by nightmares at first, which grow more and more frightening and bloody every night. They also grow increasingly real ... and beckoning.\n\n\n\u2714 A fascinating horror story that will remain in your memory for a long time.\n\u2714 Every choice you make affects the story.\n\u2714  Stylish  graphics made in black& white.\n\u2714 Original scary soundtrack will pierce you to the bones.\n\u2714 Disturbing, oppressive atmosphere.\n\u2714 Horrifying secrets.",

    "description": "ABOUT THE GAME\nThe Prometheus Secret Noohra is a game that will challenge your core and mimics life and our daily battle with shadow. Darkness contains no love and will punish you severely and unfairly with each defeat, to be a light bearer you will need great perseverance and a sharp mind to stay in the light of the Noohra. Surpassing level 1 will be the greatest challenge you will face, however the more you push back against darkness the more light will you start to regain and the easier and more rewarding the game becomes. A unique but challenging single player 2.5D physics puzzle platformer combined with fast-paced card combat.  This indie game is dedicated to all those battling their own darkness, struggling to defeat their demons. Noorah, Aramaic for the light of God, along with darkness, plays a major role in the game - not only in the story, but also dictates the mood and design.\n\nTHE STORY\n \nAs shadow, the master of deception masquerades as a light, humankind remains enslaved and wrestles against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. There is an ancient prophecy that some continue to believe in \u2013 and so, a glimpse of hope still remains. \"The people who walked in darkness Have seen a great light; Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, Upon them a light has shined.\"\n\nFollowing the trail of this prophecy leads you to the Mayan temple of Herros, there on the altar of skulls called Golgotha you discover the fire orb. The orb is filled with fire and a powerful light known as Noohra, you must become the light bearer a hero commissioned to bring light and truth back into the world. Without a hero the souls of humanity move toward the coldness of certain death.\n\nCONSUMED BY SHADOW\n\nDarkness remains infinitely deceitful and stops at nothing on its quest to destroy all that is good. The fire orb must remain filled with Noohra in order for the player to remain righteous and make any progress. Throughout the game, the player is intimidated and manipulated by darkness and it is discouraging when it seems that darkness may yet again have an unfair advantage, as each defeat will have multiple consequences. The tables are turned, level 1 will be the hardest level to surpass, the game gets easier as you persevere and progress.",

Each deck is allowed one ally nation, where you can draw support from to create an edge against the opposition. \n\nDepending on what you believe to be a winning strategy, players craft their deck on a combination of units and supporting orders.\n\nInfantry: Try to overrun your opponent with lighter and often less costly units\n\nTanks: Blitz your opponent with heavily armored units\n\nArtillery: Blast your opponent from the safety of your support line\n\nAircraft: Achieve air superiority and wreak havoc from the sky\nMove up through the ranks via gameplay from Private to Field Marshall and earn your place in the officer's club while reaping monthly rewards for your rank.\n\n\nAUTHENTIC ATMOSPHERE\nAll the cards are beautifully illustrated to match the unique WW2-style. Weapons and units have been diligently researched and behave exactly as one would expect based on official documentation, specifications and operational history.\n\n\nREGULAR UPDATES AND EVENTS\nWith a vibrant player community and active developers, KARDS is regularly getting exciting new gameplay features and improvements.

You can utilize Tag Team Technology to swap between the two playable characters on the fly throughout the game to take advantage of their separate skills and health meters. The combat system has been completely overhauled from the original and now includes many powerful, new attack moves, defensive moves and evasive moves. We also learned how to do things like split-screen scrolling for parallaxing, animated backgrounds and interactive background objects. \n\nThere are many new haunts to battle along the way. You can decapitate zombies and then use their removed heads as weapons, combo moves together to smash through the heinous hordes that are taking over the town and find hidden power ups to enhance combat moves and even smash those annoying pumpkins.",

It's also \"a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called 'one of this year's finest strategy games' back in 2009\" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)\n\nTHE MOST DEVIOUS AND ACCLAIMED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN STRATEGY GAMING RETURNS... WITH A HOST OF MUTUAL ENEMIES.\n\nFace off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.)\n\nOr immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become \"World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over.\"\n\nIf that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI.\n\n(If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)\n\n\nMODERNIZED AND SUPERCHARGED.\nIt's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will.\n\nThe interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want.\n\nSTREAMLINED, YET DEEPER.\nSometimes when a sequel says it's \"streamlined,\" it can really mean \"dumbed down.\" And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. \n\nAll those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways.\n\nThere's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element.  Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits.\n\nAs it should be.\n\nHOW ABOUT SOME HIGHLIGHTS?\n\nMany optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy.\n\nA new Fleets system gives you even more ships than before, and allows you to customize your empire more than ever.\n\nA ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied.\n\nOutguard to hire, factions to ally with, and oodles of targets to capture or hack --with the AI or aliens.\n\nWarden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other.\n\nCrazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML.\n\nWHAT'S NEW COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL?\n\nMore approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever.\n\nMore to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices.  More to find, more to conquer or be conquered-by.\n\nPolished gameplay mechanics, representing everything learned from first game\u2019s six expansions (plus three years of development on this sequel).\n\nTrimmed fat: repetitive boring tasks have been automated or streamlined, but more options than ever have been added for you to customize things when you want to.  Our goal is never to waste your time, but always have an array of interesting challenges for you to pursue at once.\n\nRedesigned UI that gives you a ton of information and power right when you need it.\n\n1.5 hours of new music added to the 4.5 hour included score from the original game.\n\nMultithreading for modern performance, and a codebase that will not summon an elder god (recoded from the ground up for modern rigs).\n\nOver 1900 lines of spoken dialogue from more than 25 actors.",

Budding city planners will have access to 200+ building blocks to arrange and combine and to create unique neighborhoods and discover the implications of their designs. The game will embark on a story of ecology and understanding as additional resources are always needed to unlock new blocks, configurations, and combinations to create more prosperous neighborhoods. Throughout the design process, players will need to avoid the decay of their city blocks by making sure each unit doesn\u2019t run out of resources and become a strain on the complimentary units around them. \n\nEnvision Your Neighborhood: Consider what Blocks are necessary for your neighborhood to thrive. There are no boundaries of what you can create with an expanding library of 200+ blocks.\nGenerate Resources: Each Block you create has inputs and outputs and by understanding how each block is dependent on other blocks, you can create a productive network. Optimize your production and generate abundant resources for the dozens of intricate symbiotic relationships in your neighborhood\n\nAvoid Decay: If blocks don't receive the inputs they need, they will decay over time and slowly become abandoned or destroyed. Once a block is abandoned or destroyed, you will have to remove it and avoid it from making other blocks decay further. Be careful as seeking an utopian neighborhood carelessly, can lead to dystopia.\n\nUnique Modes: Neighborhood designers can enjoy the new Story Mode, Sandbox Mode, and Challenge Mode with modes for unique and engaging experience for players of all types.",

It is the sound of relentless sunshine, as well as the sound of a withering race. \n\nThe \"Age of Dusk.\" It is a time of senescence for the human species, during which hybrids known as the \"Others\"\u2014those who are human, yet not\u2014exist in great numbers. On the windswept barrens of a land without moisture, a small gathering of people make their living in a world they no longer know. Down a stretch of highway and far from the heart of the town are two such people who run a small diner. To them, the circumstances that reshaped their world is of far less concern than the number of lunch boxes they can load into their delivery vehicle. After all, leaving customers hungry is not good for business, and business keeps them fed. Day after day, they occupy themselves with the endless work of their store. However, the comfortable monotony of their daily lives is turned on its head when they discover a large suitcase by the roadside on their way home from deliveries. Lying on the suitcase, unmoving, is a young girl with pink hair... \n\nThough parched, they keep each other company, \n\nand while hollow, they fill each other's voids. \n\nSo shall they live \n\non this land so arid.",

Uncover corruption and wanton punning in this HD revival of a classic freeware adventure game.\n\nThe revenue of the game - after fees and taxes are deducted - will go to the RSPB, a British charity taking care of our feathered friends (birds).\n\nSTORY\nNelly Cootalot, fearsome pirate and lover of tiny and adorable creatures, is charged by the spirit of a dead buccaneer to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a fleet of birds known as spoonbeaks. Her adventure will bring her face to face with the nefarious Baron Widebeard as she uncovers corruption and wanton punning in the Barony of Meeth.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nNelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! is your opportunity to:\n\nRescue endangered and unusually named wildfowl.\n\nAcquire morally dubious items on behalf of minor aristocrats.\n\nIntercept the private correspondances of a daredevil pilot.\n\nCome to the aid of downtrodden supernatural beings.\n\nBe confused by obscure colloquialisms.\n\nBorrow facial hair from long-dead pirates.\n\nWantonly misuse the word 'borrow'.\n\nBACKGROUND\nNelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy!\u00a0was originally released by Alasdair Beckett-King hundreds of years ago in 2007. The game started out as a birthday present for his girlfriend and got wildly out of hand. In 2016, he even made another Nelly game called Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet.\nThe HD remastering of Spoonbeaks Ahoy! brings the original game back to life, with a streamlined interface and loads more pixels and voice over (!) for the first time. Read the details below!\nAlasdair has been tweaking and polishing (and breaking and fixing) Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! for many months now. 1920x1080 HD resolution and a FULL VOICE OVER in English are the obvious highlights. Here is the\u00a0full list of the improvements we've made to the original 2007 game.\n\nNEW RESOLUTION\nThe game now runs in full 1920x1080 HD, (as well as other widescreen resolutions). This is flipping massive compared to the tiny, square original graphics (see trailer video).\n\nFULL VOICE ACTING (ENGLISH ONLY)\nExtremely cheap voice acting by Alasdair Beckett-King, real Nelly and literally no one else. Think of it as a director's commentary where he\u00a0got to do a load of dodgy accents. (Yes, this feature CAN be switched off.)\n\nSUPPORT FOR MORE OPERATING SYSTEMS\nFull support for macOS and Linux as well as all recent Windows systems.\u00a0\n\nOTHER IMPROVEMENTS\nStreamlined point & click interface.\n\nImproved launcher app.\n\nBad jokes replaced with good jokes (we\u00a0wish).\n\nNew \"business\" model",

Without warning your ragtag fleet dropped out of hyperspace into this threatening region where somehow it is merging with real space. Apparently a freak accident occurred. A freighter fleet, traversing hyperspace, has been disassembled by a mysterious force and then rematerialized in real space merging with asteroids. The attendant drone vessels survived this incident but are out of control. Seemingly they are still following their primary directive, protection of the property of their owner: the Taiko Mining Corporation.\n\nIn order to escape you must triangulate your location repeatedly. It is rather simple: leave the carrier, check navpoints, land again and move on. But the drones will not let you. So by necessity arm yourself against them by scavenging and crafting materials.\n\nSavage Vessels is a spiritual successor to Teleglitch. The levels consist of handmade regions which are procedurally combined and populated with enemies and items. Your view is obstructed and your ears constantly alert you to danger. You must deal with permadeath and some levels can be unlocked as entry levels as headstarts into each run.\n\nFEATURES\n\ntop-down pixel-art\n\ndynamic field of view\n\n10 levels, handmade regions, procedurally combined\n\ncrafting weapons, devices and consumables - all makeshift\n\ninertia + collision, based on pixel shapes\n\nsound with striking Doppler shift\n\nhard + permadeath + fair",

With a team of tools and water collecting and building fixing skills, travel across the USA and visit 24 exciting cities on your mission to ensure the safety of each building from the severe storms and their devastating weather conditions. \n\nFrom inside small houses to towering skyscrapers, containers like pans, buckets, and barrels will have to be moved around the floors to catch the dripping water and then be emptied to save the buildings from extreme damage, flooding, and destruction. The water dumped out of windows will earn you money so other containers and tools can be bought to keep the buildings standing while you withstand a constant barrage of pouring rain and never-ending threats like the UFO, Ghost, Witch Doctor, and Lightning Bolts during each storm cycle.",

His task is to blast as many of the invaders as possible, until his glorious death. To do so, he has NATO support forces, his Machinegun and Rocket Launcher at his disposal.

Players will start in the base forest environment introduced in the original ARK: Survival Evolved, with new environments and creatures introduced as the game evolves. Dedicated eSport ranking, matchmaking, reward, and tournament features make ARK: SotF readily accessible to all players. \n\nBalanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center \u2013 do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking \u201cring of death\u201d forces contestants ever closer together over time. The hunt is on!",

You just have to have an idea that is raw, and the honesty to execute it.\n\nP.T. perfectly illustrates this point. It takes place entirely in one hallway. It didn't have complicated AI. There weren't a dozen characters to design and model. Hell, there weren't even that many scares. And it was absolutely terrifying. It distilled the concepts of the ill-fated Silent Hills into a dense moment of terror. It was its own compact experience, and a glimpse into something much more.\n\nMany games have tried to imitate P.T. in content. A million spooky hallways with a trillion collectible notes. Some of these are fantastic. But what about that concept? To distill your dream project into something condensed, raw, and real?\n\nThat was the question posed to 10 brilliant creators. Make a P.T. for the horror project of your dreams. Both a game on its own, and a window into a much larger world. Make it raw. Make it real. Make it a reflection of your own fears. Make it in just 7 days.\n\nAnd they did. This is the Dread X Collection.\n\nTHE CREATORS/CREATIONS\n\n\n\nAirdorf - SUMMER NIGHT: From the creator of FAITH.
