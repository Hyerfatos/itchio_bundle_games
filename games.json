Players with less violent intent can find secret paths to complete Mable without killing anything, including bosses. \n\nUnlike most Metroidvanias Mable does not allow you to run, jump and kill on your own. Instead, you must use non-human forms to attack creatures and traverse through difficult challenges. \n\nThe strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?\n\n\nFeatures\n\nYour choices matter - The cult wants you to kill everything, but it's up to you whether or not you listen to them or find your own path and unlock the multiple endings\n\nA rich story with a diverse cast of characters who have their own take on this whole 'end of the world' thing\n\nCombat is movement and movement is combat - Mable can't lift her magical sword, so she has to use it in unique ways to move through the world\n\nA large and varied fantasy world, brought to life with state-of-the-art pixel technology and a beautiful original soundtrack\n\nMultiple endings, different routes to take through the world and secrets to discover",

Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents\u2019 identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your adoptive country? Or will you strike out on your own, turning against both your homeland and your adoptive country to shape a destiny for yourself? Love is all you need\u2026and also improvised firearms.\n\nFour Horsemen is not another hagiographic, pioneer-tradition, self-exotifying immigrant explainer about being slightly different. It is an exploration of human migration in terms of people\u2013neither as mythology nor as political platform, but as a difficult decision made by ordinary human beings caught in impossible circumstances, with consequences that ripple for generations. This isn\u2019t a game about finding yourself\u2026it\u2019s a game about your self finding you.\n\nDrawing from real lived experience, interviews with current and former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking anthropological research, featuring 4 different main storylines, 9 different endings, 12 different playable homelands (all of which play differently), and a multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen tells a powerfully compelling, heartrendingly familiar, brutally honest story about what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours, but you\u2019ll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the game has to tell\u2026and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your own.\n\nEXCITING BULLET POINTS!!\n\nYOUR DECISIONS MATTER. Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well.\n\nNO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE. Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant, you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt.\n\nNOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE. No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some questions there are no right answers--only different consequences.\n\nDELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM. Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home! Dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from your terrible day job, and make DIY versions of things you could never afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to immigrants...\n\nTRIUMPH OVER HATE. A stranger pulls a knife on you and screams at you to leave town--what do you do? Do you try to de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our combat system replicates the anxiety and terror of real violence, not a power fantasy.\n\nTHE MOST ADVANCED PROFANITY SYSTEM IN A VIDEO GAME, EVER.

However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery.

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.\n\nA few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.\n\nIn an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.\n\nNOTE FOR LINUX USERS - Due to game engine limitations we are only able to guarantee compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64bit or newer.

Novelists and poets like Pasolini, Galeano, Soriano, Hornby, Saba, Handke, Wenders have written about football and its evocative and poetic power. Same in movies, with fringe and beautiful works like The Lost World Cup or Wender's The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick. Another great inspiration was the book Football Clich\u00e9s by Adam Hurrey. \nThis naturally lead to the question: why people love football so much? \nSo we started designing a new, unique game around football, as we believe games can be a wonderful media for storytelling.\n\nA VERY SMALL TEAM\nIf you\u2019re thinking about buying Football Drama please keep in mind that we are a very passionate but small team of three - and totally self-funded by working in parallel on games for customers. This is not a blockbuster experience with many hours of content. Also if you are concerned about the price difference between Steam and mobile, we believe the right price is the one on Steam, but we are (way, way) weaker than market forces so we had to oblige. Still, the Steam version has more to offer: more information, all the in-depth parts (integrated with achievements) and full-screen illustrations.",

    "description": "NELLY COOTALOT\nNelly Cootalot is the stupidly named pirate adventurer with a heart of gold. Uncover corruption and wanton punning in this HD revival of a classic freeware adventure game.\n\nThe revenue of the game - after fees and taxes are deducted - will go to the RSPB, a British charity taking care of our feathered friends (birds).\n\nSTORY\nNelly Cootalot, fearsome pirate and lover of tiny and adorable creatures, is charged by the spirit of a dead buccaneer to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a fleet of birds known as spoonbeaks. Her adventure will bring her face to face with the nefarious Baron Widebeard as she uncovers corruption and wanton punning in the Barony of Meeth.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nNelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! is your opportunity to:\n\nRescue endangered and unusually named wildfowl.\n\nAcquire morally dubious items on behalf of minor aristocrats.\n\nIntercept the private correspondances of a daredevil pilot.\n\nCome to the aid of downtrodden supernatural beings.\n\nBe confused by obscure colloquialisms.\n\nBorrow facial hair from long-dead pirates.\n\nWantonly misuse the word 'borrow'.\n\nBACKGROUND\nNelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy!\u00a0was originally released by Alasdair Beckett-King hundreds of years ago in 2007. The game started out as a birthday present for his girlfriend and got wildly out of hand. In 2016, he even made another Nelly game called Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet.\nThe HD remastering of Spoonbeaks Ahoy! brings the original game back to life, with a streamlined interface and loads more pixels and voice over (!) for the first time. Read the details below!\nAlasdair has been tweaking and polishing (and breaking and fixing) Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! for many months now. 1920x1080 HD resolution and a FULL VOICE OVER in English are the obvious highlights. Here is the\u00a0full list of the improvements we've made to the original 2007 game.\n\nNEW RESOLUTION\nThe game now runs in full 1920x1080 HD, (as well as other widescreen resolutions). This is flipping massive compared to the tiny, square original graphics (see trailer video).\n\nFULL VOICE ACTING (ENGLISH ONLY)\nExtremely cheap voice acting by Alasdair Beckett-King, real Nelly and literally no one else. Think of it as a director's commentary where he\u00a0got to do a load of dodgy accents. (Yes, this feature CAN be switched off.)\n\nSUPPORT FOR MORE OPERATING SYSTEMS\nFull support for macOS and Linux as well as all recent Windows systems.\u00a0\n\nOTHER IMPROVEMENTS\nStreamlined point & click interface.\n\nImproved launcher app.\n\nBad jokes replaced with good jokes (we\u00a0wish).\n\nNew \"business\" model",
